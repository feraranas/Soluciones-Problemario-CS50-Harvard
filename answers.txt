sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: Merge sort recursively divides the list into two repeatedly and then merges the smaller lists back into a larger one in the correct order.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: Selection sort iterates through the unsorted portions of a list, selecting the smallest element each time and moving it to its correct location.
